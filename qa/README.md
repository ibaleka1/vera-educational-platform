## 🔧 Configuration

### SLA Thresholds (Customizable)
```javascript
slaThresholds: {
    pageLoadTime: 3000,      // 3 seconds max
    timeToInteractive: 5000, // 5 seconds max  
    memoryUsage: 50,         // 50MB max
    domNodes: 1000,          // 1000 nodes max
    resourceCount: 50,       // 50 resources max
}
```

### Test Scope Configuration
Each test suite can be customized for specific requirements:
- Enable/disable specific test categories
- Adjust severity levels and scoring
- Configure compliance requirements
- Set performance benchmarks

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Complete QA Process
```javascript
// Run full production validation
const qaController = new VERAQAMasterController();
const results = await qaController.runCompleteQAProcess();

console.log('Production Ready:', results.executiveSummary.productionReady);
console.log('Overall Score:', results.executiveSummary.overallScore);
```

### Security-Only Validation
```javascript
// Focus on security compliance
const security = new VERASecurityValidator();
const securityResults = await security.runSecurityAudit();

if (securityResults.vulnerabilities.critical > 0) {
    console.log('BLOCKED: Critical security issues detected');
}
```

### Performance Benchmarking
```javascript
// Validate performance SLAs
const performance = new VERAPerformanceTester();
const perfResults = await performance.runPerformanceAudit();

console.log('SLA Violations:', perfResults.slaViolations);
console.log('Performance Score:', perfResults.score);
```

## 🚨 Critical Issue Handling

### Production Blockers
The QA system identifies critical issues that block production deployment:
- Navigation system failures
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- SLA violations (performance)
- Data integrity issues
- Core functionality failures

### Automatic Reporting
All critical issues are:
- Logged with detailed context
- Included in executive summary
- Marked as deployment blockers
- Provided with remediation recommendations

## 🔄 Integration with CI/CD

### Automated Testing
The QA suite can be integrated into deployment pipelines:
```bash
# Run headless QA validation
node qa-validation.js --headless --output=report.json
```

### Quality Gates
Use QA results as deployment gates:
- Block deployment if overall score < 85
- Require manual approval if critical issues detected
- Auto-deploy if all criteria met

## 📈 Continuous Improvement

### Metrics Tracking
- Test execution time trending
- Issue detection rate analysis
- Performance regression monitoring
- Security posture improvement

### Report Analytics
- Executive dashboard integration
- Historical trend analysis
- Predictive quality metrics
- Automated alerting capabilities

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Tests fail to load**: Ensure all JS files are accessible
2. **Console errors**: Check browser compatibility
3. **Incomplete results**: Verify test execution permissions
4. **Performance variance**: Account for system resource availability

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:
```javascript
// Enable debug output
window.QA_DEBUG = true;
runVERAQA();
```

## 📞 Support

For technical issues or customization requests:
- Review console logs for detailed error information
- Check browser developer tools for runtime issues
- Validate file permissions and accessibility
- Ensure all dependencies are properly loaded
